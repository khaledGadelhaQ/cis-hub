# Phase 6: Performance Optimizations ⚡

**Status:** ⏳ Pending Phase 5 Completion  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Dependencies:** Phase 1-5 must be completed

## Overview

This final phase focuses on performance optimizations, scalability improvements, and production-ready features for handling high notification volumes.

## Key Optimizations

### 6.1 Notification Queuing
- Batch processing for high-traffic groups
- Rate limiting to prevent FCM quota exhaustion
- Priority queuing for different notification types

### 6.2 Caching Layer
- User notification preferences cache
- Room member lists cache
- Online user status cache
- Topic subscription status cache

### 6.3 Database Optimizations
- Strategic database indexes
- Query optimization
- Connection pooling
- Read replicas for notification queries

## Performance Targets

- **Notification Latency:** <500ms for individual notifications
- **Topic Notifications:** <1s for groups up to 1000 members
- **Database Performance:** <100ms average query time
- **Cache Hit Rate:** >95% for frequently accessed data

## Monitoring & Analytics

- Notification delivery success rates
- Performance metrics and alerts
- User engagement analytics
- Error tracking and reporting
