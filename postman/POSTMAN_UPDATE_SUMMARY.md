# Postman Collection Update Summary

## Updated: MU-Compass-API.postman_collection.json

### 🔄 Latest Changes (Academic System Enhancement)

#### 🧹 **Code Cleanup**

##### Removed Redundant Enrollments Module
- **Action**: Completely removed `/src/modules/academic/enrollments/` directory
- **Reason**: All enrollment functionality has been consolidated into the courses service
- **Impact**: 
  - Cleaner codebase with no duplicate functionality
  - All enrollment operations now handled via `/academic/courses/enrollments` endpoints
  - Removed `EnrollmentsModule` from `AcademicModule` imports/exports
  - No breaking changes to API endpoints (all enrollment endpoints remain functional)

#### 🆕 **New Endpoints Added**

##### 1. Department Transition Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /users/{id}/transition-department`
- **Location**: "👥 User Management (Admin)" folder
- **Purpose**: Transition students from GE to specialized departments (CS/IT/IS)
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive description of transition process
  - Validation for student eligibility
  - Test scripts for success verification
  - Body template with `newDepartmentId` parameter

##### 2. Enhanced Enrollment Validation Tests
- **Location**: "📚 Academic - Courses" > "Course Enrollments"
- **New Test Cases**:
  - Test rejection of GE students enrolling in specialized courses
  - Test acceptance of specialized students enrolling in GE courses
  - Comprehensive test scripts with validation logic

##### 3. Academic Workflow Tests Section
- **New Main Folder**: "🔄 Academic Workflow Tests"
- **Contains**: Complete 6-step student journey test
- **Purpose**: End-to-end testing of academic system business logic

#### 📝 **Enhanced Existing Endpoints**

##### Course Enrollment (Student)
- Added comprehensive description explaining business logic:
  - Year 1-2 students (GE) restricted to GE courses
  - Year 3-4 students can enroll in department + GE courses
  - Cross-department enrollment restrictions

##### Department Transition
- Added detailed description covering:
  - Eligibility validation process
  - Academic integrity enforcement
  - Use case for completing general education

#### 🆕 **New Collection Variables**
```json
{
  "testStudentId": "",           // Test student ID for workflows
  "csDepartmentId": "",          // CS department ID
  "currentDeptId": "",           // Current department tracking
  "testEnrollmentId": ""         // Test enrollment tracking
}
```

#### 🔧 **Complete Student Journey Test Workflow**

**6-Step Test Process**:
1. **Get Year 2 GE Student** - Find test subject
2. **Get CS Department ID** - Retrieve transition target
3. **Try CS Enrollment (Should Fail)** - Test pre-transition validation
4. **Transition Department** - Perform GE → CS transition
5. **Update to Year 3** - Manual year advancement for testing
6. **Try CS Enrollment (Should Succeed)** - Test post-transition validation

Each step includes automated test scripts and variable management.

### 🎯 New API Structure Alignment

The collection now perfectly matches the new backend structure:

```
/academic/courses/*                    # Core course CRUD
/academic/courses/classes/*            # Class management
/academic/courses/sections/*           # Section management  
/academic/courses/classes/professors/* # Professor assignments
/academic/courses/enrollments/*        # Enrollment management
```

### 🔧 Request Body Updates

#### Course Creation
```json
{
  "name": "Advanced Web Development",
  "code": "CS401", 
  "description": "Advanced concepts...",
  "creditHours": 3,
  "departmentId": "{{departmentId}}",
  "targetYear": 4  // Changed from "year"
}
```

#### Department Creation
```json
{
  "name": "COMPUTER_SCIENCE",  // Enum value
  "code": "CS",                // Enum value
  "description": "Computer Science Department"
}
```

### 🚀 Ready for Testing

The collection is now fully aligned with the new schema and backend implementation. All endpoints include:
- Proper authentication headers
- Correct request/response formats
- Variable management for IDs
- Error-free JSON structure

### 📋 Testing Workflow

1. **Authentication** → Login and save tokens
2. **Department Setup** → Create/get departments 
3. **Course Management** → Create courses
4. **Class Setup** → Create classes for courses
5. **Section Setup** → Create sections with TAs
6. **Professor Assignment** → Assign professors to classes
7. **Enrollment Management** → Enroll students in courses/classes/sections

All requests are properly structured and ready for API testing with the updated backend.
